Abstract: Problem statement: Power-Voltage curve provides very important information for voltage
stability analysis. The exact medium transmission line model consists of the resistance and the
reactance. The resistance causes in the active line loss. It is not easy task to achieve the power-voltage
curve characteristics of power system with the exact medium line model. Approach: This study
applies the concept of the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively solve the nonlinear power flow
equations. The Power-Voltage (P-V) curve charateristic of the system without line loss and with line
loss are plotted and compared on various cases. Results: It is found from the study that the resistance
of the line obviously provides the negative effects on the voltage stability. The line loss causes in the
decrement of the critical point. In addition, it is found that the leading power factor can increase the
critical point of P-V curve. Conclusion: The exact medium line model should be considered for
voltage stability analysis of the system with the medium transmission line.

Power system stability is classified as rotor angle
stability and voltage stability. Voltage stability is a
stability in power systems which are heavily loaded,
distubeanced or have a mediumage of reactive power.
Nowadays, the demand of electricity has dramatically
increased and a modern power system becomes a
complex network of transmission lines interconnecting
the generating stations to the major loads points in the
overall power system in order to support the high
demand of consumers. It is becoming increasingly
important to fully utilize the existing transmission
system assets due to environmental legislation, rightsof-way issues and costs of construction and
deregulation policies that introduced in recent years. A
number of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS)
controllers, based on the rapid development of power
electronics technology, have been proposed for better
utilization of the existing transmission systems
(Subramani et al., 2012; Omar et al., 2010; Osuwa and
Igwiro, 2010; Marimuthu and Thangaraj, 2010; ZarateMinano et al., 2010)

The evaluation of the power-votage (P-V) curve of
the power system is one of the most important research
areas for power engineers because it indicates the
maximum power load. If the load is increased beyond
the maximu value, the voltage will be collapsed and
then the system is considered as unstable.

The transmission line is one of the most important
parts in power system components. Most of the fault
occurs at the transmission line. It is generally divided
into three major categories; medium, medium and long
model whose distance are about 80 km, above 80-250
and above 250 km, respectively. Many previous
researches used simple transmission line model by
neglecting its resistance or capacitance. To fully
utilization the existing system, the exact transmission
line should be further investigated. This study investigated the effects of line losss in
medium transmission line on voltage stability. The
mathematical model of the power flow is systematically
derived. The concept of the Newton-Raphson method
is applied to iteratively solve the nonlinear power flow
equations. The Power-Voltage (P-V) curve charateristic
of the system without line loss and with line loss are
plotted, discussed and compared on various cases. 

Mathematical model: Consider the simple system as
shown in Fig. 1. The generator supplies the active
power and reactive power, which is transferred through
a transmission line to the load. The voltage at generator
bus (VS) is considered as constant value. The exact
medium transmission line model is represented by the
series impedance (Z) consisting of a resistance (R) and
reactance (X) and shunt admittance (Y) or susceptance
line charging (B). The load is represented by the active
(PR) and reactive power (QR).

A₁ = (1 + YZ/2)                                    (1)
B = Z                                              (2)
C = Y(1 + YZ/4)                                    (3)
D₁ = A₁                                            (4)
From Eq. 1-4, the voltage and the current at load
bus (VR,IR) can be expressed in terms of matrix by:
[VR] = [D  -B] [VS]
[IR]   [-C  A ] [IS]                               (5)
From Eq. 5, the line current at load bus is given by
Eq. 6:
IR = (VS - AVR)/B = (VSZ(δ - θR) - AVR)/B ∠(θA - θR)   (6)
The complex power load is written by Eq. 7:
SR = PR + jQR = VRIR*
   = (VRVS)/B ∠(θR - δ) - (AVR²)/B ∠(θR - θA)    (7)
Then the active and reactive power load are given
by Eq. 8 and 9:
PR = (VRVS)/B cos(θR - δ) - (AVR²)/B cos(θR - θA)  (8)
And:
QR = (VRVS)/B sin(θR - δ) - (AVR²)/B sin(θR - θA)  (9)

The objective of this study is to evaluate the
voltage at load bus (VR) with various cases of load. This
study applies the Newton-Raphson method to
iteratively solve the nonlinear Eq. of 3 and 4 given by
Eq. 10:
[ΔPR]   [∂PR/∂δ    ∂PR/∂VR] [Δδ]
[ΔQR] = [∂QR/∂δ    ∂QR/∂VR] [ΔV]                    (10)
The general form of (5) is given by Eq. 11:
[ΔPR]   [J1    J2] [Δδ]
[ΔQR] = [J3    J4] [ΔV]                              (11)
This study will investigate the effect of line loss on
voltage stability of the system and be compared that of
without line loss. Without line loss, the active and
reactive powers are given by Eq. 12 and 13:
PR = (VRVS/X) sin δ                                   (12)
And:
QR = (VR/X)[VR - VS cos δ]                           (13)
The characteristic of the P-V curve for neglecting
line loss is shown in Fig. 2. The power system are
operated in upper part of the P-V curve. The head of the
P-V curve is called the critical point (V_R^cr, P_R^cr). The
critical point provides very important information to
power system engineers. If the system supplies load
beyond P_R^cr, it causes in voltage collapse.

The proposed method is tested on the sample
system consider the diagram of sample system is shown
in Fig. 1. The system supplies power which is
transferred through a 130 km transmission line to the
load. The system voltage at the generator bus is 345 kV.
Fig. 3 shows the P-V curve of the system with various
parameters of the medium transmission line. 

It can be seen from the Fig. 3 and Table 1 that with
a reactance the critical power is around 1517 W and
coresponse to the critical voltage at 244 kV. It can be
seen from the Figure that the resistance of the line
significantly affects on the P-V curve whereas the
susceptance line charging slightly affects on the P-V
curve. With the resistance and line charging, the critical
power is decreased around to 1300 W. It was found in
this study that the power factor affects on the critical
point of the system. The increment of the leading power
factor makes it possible to supply more power to the
load. With tan φ = -0.4, the capability of the system for
sending the active power to the load is around 1900 W.
In contrast, with lagging power factor the critical point
of the system is decreased. It can be observed from Fig.
4 and Table 2 that with tan φ = 0.4the critical power is
decresed around to 950 W. 

This study investigated the effects of line loss in
medium transmission line on voltage stability. The
mathematical model of the power flow is systematically
derived. The concept of the Newton-Raphson method is
applied to iteratively solve the nonlinear power flow
equations. The power-voltage (P-V) curve characteristic
of the system without line loss and with line loss are
plotted, discussed and compared on various cases. 

It was found from the study that the resistance of
the line obviously provides significantly negative
effects on the voltage stability whereas the susceptance
line charging improve slightly critical point. In
addition, it was found that the leading power factor can
significantly increase the critical point of P-V curve.
Thus to achieve the actual capability of the system, the
exact medium line model is needed to be considered.
