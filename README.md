# PV Curve LLM

An interactive chat-based application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Power-Voltage (PV) curves and provide AI-powered voltage stability analysis for power systems. Users can interact with the system through a natural language chat interface to obtain technical insights, mathematical analysis, and visual representations of power system voltage stability concepts.

## Overview

This application combines modern web technologies with artificial intelligence to make power system voltage analysis more accessible and interactive. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a vector database of power systems literature to provide accurate, context-aware responses about PV curves, voltage stability, and related power system phenomena.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend components:

**Frontend (`/ui`)**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React-based web application
- Provides the chat interface for user interactions
- Handles visualization of PV curves and analysis results
- Run instructions available in `/ui/README.md`

**Backend (`/server`)**
- Flask server providing REST API endpoints
- AI agent powered by local LLM (DeepSeek) with RAG capabilities
- Vector database integration for technical document retrieval
- Run instructions available in `/server/README.md`

## TODO

- [ ] Add more training data
- [ ] Verify training data
- [ ] Develop PV-Curve generation
- [ ] Connect PV-Curve generation script to AI model
- [ ] Finish and update all documentation across project
- [ ] Add properly formatted references to `README.md`

## Contributing

This is an **open source project** and contributions are welcome and encouraged.
