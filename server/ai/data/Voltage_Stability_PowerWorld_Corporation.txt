Voltage Stability: The ability to maintain system
voltage so that both power and voltage are
controllable. System voltage responds as expected
(i.e., an increase in load causes proportional
decrease in voltage).

Voltage Instability: Inability to maintain system
voltage. System voltage and/or power become
uncontrollable. System voltage does not respond
as expected.

Voltage Collapse: Process by which voltage
instability leads to unacceptably low voltages in a
significant portion of the system. Typically results
in loss of system load.

Classified by either size of disturbance or duration
– Small or large disturbance: small disturbance is just
perturbations about an equilibrium point (power flow)
– Short-term (several seconds) or long-term (many
seconds to minutes)

Small Disturbance Voltage Stability
• Small disturbance voltage stability can be assessed
using a power flow (maximum loadability)
• Depending on the assumed load model, the power
flow can have multiple (or now solutions)
• PV curve is created by plotting power versus
voltage

Two-Bus System Example
Consider a simple two-bus system where:
• Bus 1 is the slack bus with voltage V_slack = 1.0
• Bus 2 is the load bus with voltage V∠0
• Line reactance X = 0.2 between the buses
• Line susceptance B = -10
The power flow equations for this system are:
P_L - BV sin θ = 0
Q_L + BV cos θ - BV² = 0
Where:
• B is the line susceptance = -10
• V∠0 is the load voltage
• θ is the phase angle difference between buses
• P_L is the active power load
• Q_L is the reactive power load
This simple system can be used to demonstrate voltage stability concepts and the development of PV curves through systematic analysis of load variations.

Small Disturbance Voltage
Stability
• Question: how do the power flow solutions vary as
the load is changed?
• A Solution: Calculate a series of power flow
solutions for various load levels and see how they
change
• Power flow Jacobian

The Jacobian matrix for the two-bus system is:
J(θ,V) = [[-BV cos θ,     -B sin θ    ]
          [-BV sin θ,  B cos θ - 2BV]]
The determinant of the Jacobian matrix is:
det J(θ,V) = VB² (2V cos θ - cos² θ - sin² θ)
The system becomes singular when:
(2V cos θ - 1) = 0
This singularity condition indicates the point of voltage collapse, where the power flow Jacobian becomes non-invertible and the system loses voltage controllability.

Maximum Loadability When
Power Flow Jacobian is Singular
• An important paper considering this was by Sauer
and Pai from IEEE Trans. Power Systems in Nov
1990, “Power system steady-state stability and the
load-flow Jacobian”
• Other earlier papers were looking at the
characteristics of multiple power flow solutions
• Work with the power flow optimal multiplier
around the same time had shown that optimal
multiplier goes to zero as the power flow Jacobian
becomes singular
• The power flow Jacobian depends on the assumed
load model

Relationship Between Stability and Power Flow Jacobian
• The Sauer/Pai paper related system stability to
the power flow Jacobian by noting the system
dynamics could be written as a set of
differential algebraic equations
The system dynamics can be expressed as:
ẋ = f(x, y, p)
0 = g(x, y, p)
Linearizing about an equilibrium gives:
[Δẋ]   [∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y] [Δx]
[0 ] = [∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y] [Δy]
What Sauer and Pai show is if ∂g/∂y is singular then the system is unstable; if ∂g/∂y is nonsingular then the system may or may not be stable. Hence it provides an upper bound on stability.

Relationship Between Stability
and Power Flow Jacobian
Assuming ∂g/∂y is nonsingular then:
Δẋ = [∂f/∂x - ∂f/∂y[∂g/∂y]^(-1)∂g/∂x] Δx
What Sauer and Pai show is if ∂g/ ∂ y is
singular then the system is unstable; if ∂g/ ∂ y
is nonsingular then the system may or may
not be stable
• Hence it provides an upper bound on stability

Bifurcations
• In general, bifurcation is the division of something
into two branches or parts
• For a dynamic system, a bifurcation occurs when
small changes in a parameter cause a new quality of
motion of the dynamic system
• Two types of bifurcation are considered for voltage
stability
– Saddle node bifurcation is the disappearance of an
equilibrium point for parameter variation; for voltage
stability it is two power flow solutions coalescing with
parameter variation
– Hopf bifurcation is cause by two eigenvalues crossing
into the right-half plane

PV and QV Curves
• PV curves can be traced by plotting the
voltage as the real power is increased; QV
curves as reactive power is increased
– At least for the upper portion of the curve

Small Disturbance Voltage
Collapse
• At constant frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) the complex
power transferred down a transmission line is S=VI*
– V is phasor voltage, I is phasor current
– This is the reason for using a high voltage grid
• Line real power losses are given by RI^2 and reactive
power losses by XI^2
– R is the line’s resistance, and X its reactance; for a high
voltage line X >> R
• Increased reactive power tends to drive down the
voltage, which increases the current, which further
increases the reactive power losses

Load Parameter Space
Representation
• With a constant power model there is a maximum
loadability surface, S
– Defined as point in which the power flow Jacobian is
singular
– For the lossless two bus system it can be determined
as
P_L²/B + Q_L + 1/4 B = 0

Load Model Impact
• With a static load model regardless of the voltage
dependency the same PV curve is traced
– But whether a point of maximum loadability exists
depends on the assumed load model
• If voltage exponent is > 1 then multiple solutions do not exist
(see B.C. Lesieutre, P.W. Sauer and M.A. Pai “Sufficient
conditions on static load models for network solvability,”NAPS
1992, pp. 262-271)

Application: Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR)
• If the “steady-state” load has a true dependence on
voltage, then a change (usually a reduction) in the
voltage should result in a total decrease in energy
consumption
• If an “optimal” voltage could be determined, then
this could result in a net energy savings
• Some challenges are 1) the voltage profile across a
feeder is not constant, 2) the load composition is
constantly changing, 3) a decrease in power
consumption might result in a decrease in useable
output from the load, and 4) loads are dynamic and
an initial increase might be balanced by a later
increase

Determining a Metric to VoltageCollapse
• The goal of much of the voltage stability work was to
determine an easy to calculate metric (or metrics) of
the current operating point to voltage collapse
– PV and QV curves (or some combination) can determine
such a metric along a particular path
– Goal was to have a path independent metric. The closest
boundary point was considered,
but this could be quite misleading
if the system was not going to
move in that direction
– Any linearization about the current operating point (i.e.,
the Jacobian) does not consider important nonlinearities
like generators hitting their reactive power limits

Assessing Voltage Margin Using PV and QV Curve Analysis
• A common method for assessing the distance
in parameter space to voltage instability (or an
undesirable voltage profile) is to trace how the
voltage magnitudes vary as the system
parameters (such as the loads) are changed in
a specified direction
– If the direction involves changing the real power
(P) this is known as a PV curve; if the change is
with the reactive power (Q) then this is a QV curve
• PV/QV curve analysis can be generalized to
any parameter change, and can include the
consideration of contingencies

PV and QV Analysis in PowerWorld
• Requires setting up what is known in PowerWorld
as an injection group
– An injection group specifies a set of objects, such as
generators and loads, that can inject or absorb power
– Injection groups can be defined by selecting Case
Information, Aggregation, Injection Groups
• The PV and/or QV analysis then varies the
injections in the injection group, tracing out the PV
curve
• This allows optional consideration of contingencies
• The PV tool can be displayed by selecting Add-Ons,
PV

Shorter Term Dynamics
• On a shorter time-scale (minutes down to
seconds) voltage stability is impacted by
controls hitting limits (such as the action of
generator over excitation limiters), the
movement of voltage control devices (such as
LTC transformers) and load dynamics
– Motor stalling can have a major impact
• The potential for voltage
instability can be quantified
by looking at the amount
and duration of voltage
dips following an event

Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR)
• FIDVR is a situation in which the system
voltage remains significantly reduced for at
least several seconds following a fault (at
either the transmission or distribution level)
– It is most concerning in the high voltage grid, but
found to be unexpectedly prevalent in the
distribution system
• Stalled residential air
conditioning units are a
key cause of FIDVR – they can stall within the
three cycles needed to
clear a fault
