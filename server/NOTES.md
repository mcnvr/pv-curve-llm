# Temporary Notes File

While in the earliest development stages, this is temporary for me to keep track of what I need to add to the README.md soon to stay more organized

PV-Curve functionality might not work well. At this time, I have no Power Systems experience and am still learning/reseraching basics.

## TODO

[_] Create README.md
[_] Create virtual environment or Docker container
[_] Set up Deepseek model locally
[_] Other stuff

## Necessary Dependencies (for now)

## Potential tools for RAG:

- Langchain
